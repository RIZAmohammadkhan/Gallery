# **App Name**: Gemini Gallery

## Core Features:

- AI-powered Image Categorization: Utilize the Gemini API to categorize images into user-defined folders based on image content. The Gemini API analyzes the content of each image to determine its most relevant category using a tool.
- Automatic Defect Detection: Automatically identify and move accidental or defective images (e.g., blurry, duplicates) to a dedicated 'Bin' folder using AI. Users can then review and restore or permanently delete these images. The Gemini API analyzes the quality of the images using a tool.
- AI Metadata Generation: Automatically generate detailed metadata for each image using the Gemini API, including descriptions of the objects, scenes, and subjects within the image using a tool. The description would be short - approximately one sentence per image.
- Intelligent Image Search: Enable users to search for images using natural language queries based on the AI-generated metadata, rather than relying on filenames or tags.
- Manual Folder Creation: Allow users to create and manage custom folders for organizing their images.
- Image Restoration and Deletion: Provide users with options to restore images from the 'Bin' folder back to their original location or permanently delete them.
- Image editing with AI: Edit the current image with the help of a generative AI
