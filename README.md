## ‚ú® Key Features

This application isn't just a simple image viewer; it's an intelligent assistant for your photos:

-   **üì∏ Intelligent Uploads & Analysis:**
    -   **AI-Powered Metadata:** Upon upload, each image is automatically analyzed by Google's Gemini AI. It generates descriptive titles, detailed content descriptions (`metadata`), and relevant keywords (`tags`).
    -   **Defect Detection:** AI proactively identifies and flags potentially problematic images such as blurry shots, low-quality photos, or accidental screenshots (`isDefective`, `defectType`). These are automatically moved to a dedicated "Bin" for review.
    -   **Smart Categorization:** Leveraging AI, the system intelligently suggests and can automatically assign newly uploaded, non-defective images to existing user-defined folders.
-   **üîç Advanced Search Capabilities:**
    -   **Natural Language Search:** Use conversational queries like "blurry photos of the city at night" to semantically search your entire collection based on AI-generated descriptions and tags.
-   **üé® AI Image Editing:**
    -   **Generative Edits:** Describe desired changes to an image in plain language (e.g., "make the sky purple") and watch as AI generates a new, edited version.
-   **üóÇÔ∏è Intuitive Organization:**
    -   **Custom Folders:** Create and manage your own folders to manually organize images.
    -   **Drag-and-Drop:** Easily move images between folders or to the bin using intuitive drag-and-drop gestures.
    -   **Bulk Actions:** Select multiple images to perform bulk operations like moving to the bin, exporting, or sharing.
-   **üîó Secure Sharing:**
    -   **Ephemeral Galleries:** Generate secure, time-limited shareable links for a selection of your images, perfect for sharing with friends and family without compromising your main gallery.
    -   **Access Control:** Shared galleries include access tracking and automatic expiration.
-   **üîê Robust Security:**
    -   **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login are handled by NextAuth.js.
    -   **Database-backed Storage:** Unlike traditional galleries that store images on a public file system, all image data is securely embedded within the MongoDB database, preventing direct URL access to raw image files.

## ü§ñ How AI Works Under the Hood (Genkit Flows)

The intelligence of AI Gallery Studio is powered by [Google AI Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) and orchestrated using [Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit), an open-source framework for building AI-powered applications.

In this project, Genkit defines several "flows," each responsible for a specific AI task:

-   `/src/ai/flows/generate-image-metadata-flow.ts`:
    -   **Purpose:** Takes an image and generates a concise title, a detailed descriptive paragraph, and an array of relevant keywords.
    -   **Contribution:** Populates the `name`, `metadata`, and `tags` fields for each image, enabling rich searching.
-   `/src/ai/flows/detect-defective-images-flow.ts`:
    -   **Purpose:** Analyzes an image for common flaws like blurriness or low quality.
    -   **Contribution:** Sets the `isDefective` flag, allowing for automatic moving to the bin.
-   `/src/ai/flows/categorize-images-flow.ts`:
    -   **Purpose:** Given an image and a list of existing folder names, it predicts the most appropriate folder.
    -   **Contribution:** Facilitates automatic organization of new uploads.
-   `/src/ai/flows/advanced-search-images-flow.ts`:
    -   **Purpose:** An enhanced semantic search that understands complex queries and matches them against all available AI-generated metadata.
    -   **Contribution:** Powers the rich search experience.
-   `/src/ai/flows/edit-image-flow.ts`:
    -   **Purpose:** Takes an image and a textual description and uses generative AI to produce a new, modified image.
    -   **Contribution:** Enables creative, AI-driven image manipulation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these detailed instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js (v18 or later):** Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
-   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
-   **Docker Desktop:** Includes Docker Engine and Docker Compose. Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

---

### üê≥ Option 1: Running with Docker (Recommended)

This method provides a consistent, isolated environment for the application and its database. The included helper scripts automate the entire process.

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd studio
```

**2. Configure Environment Variables**

This project uses a `.env` file for configuration. Your scripts simplify its creation.

-   **Create `.env` file:** Copy the provided Docker template:
    ```bash
    cp .env.docker.example .env
    ```
    *Note: The `docker-run.sh` script will do this for you if you forget.*

-   **Add your Google AI API Key:** Open the newly created `.env` file and replace the placeholder for `GEMINI_API_KEY`:
    ```ini
    # .env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your-google-ai-api-key-here
    ```
    > **Get your API Key:** Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to generate a free API key. Without it, AI features will be disabled.

**3. Run the Application with Helper Scripts**

Make the scripts executable first:
```bash
chmod +x docker-run.sh docker-run-custom.sh docker-stop.sh
```

#### 3.1. Easy Start (Automatic Port Management)

The `docker-run.sh` script is the simplest way to start. It intelligently finds available ports, builds the Docker images, and starts the services.

```bash
./docker-run.sh
```

#### 3.2. Custom Ports (Advanced Control)

Use `docker-run-custom.sh` if you need to specify which ports to use. The script will fail if your chosen ports are already occupied.

-   **Example:** Run the app on port `8080` and MongoDB on `27018`:
    ```bash
    ./docker-run-custom.sh --app-port 8080 --mongo-port 27018
    ```
-   See all options: `./docker-run-custom.sh --help`

**4. Access the Application**

After running either script, open your web browser and navigate to the application URL provided in the terminal output (e.g., `http://localhost:9002`).

**5. Managing Your Docker Environment**

-   **To stop the containers (Preserves Data):** This command stops the containers but leaves your database volume intact.
    ```bash
    ./docker-stop.sh
    ```

-   **To stop and remove ALL data:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This will permanently delete the MongoDB data volume.
    ```bash
    ./docker-stop.sh --remove
    ```

-   **To view container logs:**
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f
    ```

---

### üíª Option 2: Running Locally (For Active Development)

This option is for developers who want to work directly on the codebase.

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd studio
```

**2. Run the Local Setup Script**

This script will check your Node.js version, install dependencies, create a `.env` file, and generate a secure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**3. Configure Environment Variables**

Open the `.env` file and add your keys:

-   `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
-   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google AI API key.

**4. Set Up MongoDB**

Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running. You can install it locally, use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas, or run it in a separate Docker container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name local-mongo mongo:7.0
```

**5. Test MongoDB Connection**

It's highly recommended to run this utility script to verify your `MONGODB_URI` is correct:
```bash
npm run test-mongodb
```

**6. Run the Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be running on **http://localhost:9002**.

### Understanding the `.env` File Workflow in Docker

Your project uses a specific and robust method for handling Docker environment variables:

1.  **Template:** The `.env.docker.example` file is a public template committed to Git. It shows what variables are needed.
2.  **Creation:** When you run `./docker-run.sh` or `./docker-run-custom.sh`, the script checks for a `.env` file. If it's missing, it copies `.env.docker.example` to create `.env`.
3.  **Configuration:** You add your secrets (like `GEMINI_API_KEY`) to the `.env` file. This file is listed in `.gitignore` and should never be committed to version control.
4.  **Execution:** `Docker Compose` automatically reads the `.env` file and uses its values to substitute variables (like `${APP_PORT}`) inside the `docker-compose.yml` file. These values are then passed to the Docker containers at build time and runtime.

This workflow ensures that secrets are kept local while providing a clear template for new developers.
