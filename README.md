# Intelligent AI Photo Gallery

This is a modern, responsive photo gallery application built with Next.js and powered by Google's Gemini AI models through Genkit. It provides intelligent features to automatically organize, analyze, search, and edit your images.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: When you upload an image, the app automatically generates a descriptive title, a detailed paragraph of metadata, and relevant tags.
- **Automatic Categorization**: The AI analyzes new uploads and intelligently moves them into the most relevant user-created folder.
- **Defective Image Detection**: The app can identify and flag potentially blurry, low-quality, or accidental photos, moving them to a separate 'Bin' for review.
- **Advanced Natural Language Search**: Go beyond simple tags. You can search your gallery using complex, natural language queries like "blurry photos of the city" or "best shots of nature."
- **AI-Powered Editing**: Edit images by simply describing the changes you want to make (e.g., "make the sky purple and add a cat on the bench").
- **Modern, Responsive UI**: The interface is built with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components, featuring a clean, dark theme that looks great on any device.
- **Drag-and-Drop Organization**: Easily move images between folders, into the 'Uncategorized' section, or to the 'Bin' with a simple drag-and-drop interface.
- **Image Selection & Sharing**: Select multiple images and generate a temporary, shareable link to show them off to others.
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple images to move them to the Bin at once or export them as a ZIP file for easy downloading and sharing.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation and bulk operations (Ctrl/Cmd+A to toggle select all/none, Delete to move to bin, Ctrl/Cmd+E to export, Escape to exit selection mode).
- **üÜï Cloud Storage Integration**: Backup and sync your images with Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive for cross-device access and data safety.
- **üÜï UI-Based API Configuration**: Configure your Gemini AI API key directly through the web interface - no environment variables needed!
- **üÜï Open Source Ready**: Easy deployment and setup for anyone - just enter your API key and start using!
